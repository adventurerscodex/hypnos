/**
 * A APIResponse is a convenience wrapper around the data received when doing
 * a mapped query to the API.
 *
 * If a model instance is provided, the APIResponse will map the response data
 * to the model (see Model Serialization for more information). The APIResponse
 * also remembers the original response data for reference.
 *
 * Accessing the Response Objects
 * ------------------------------
 * Depending on the type of query, responses are mapped to either the `object`
 * or `objects` (note the plural) property on the APIResponse. In the case of
 * a query that will return multiple objects (i.e. when the `many` flag is set)
 * the resulting objects will be mapped and set to the `objects` property.
 * Otherwise single objects are always mapped to the `object` property.
 *
 * Navigating Paginated Responses
 * ------------------------------
 * A APIResponse provides an easy way to navigate through paginated results.
 * When retrieving a result set that is paginated (i.e. with
 * `Persistence.service.list()`), APIResponse provides two convenience methods:
 *
 * - getNextPage: Will fetch the next page in a result set if there is one.
 * - getPreviousPage: Will fetch the previous page in a result set if there is one.
 *
 * Using these two methods you can navigate the results of the query you made
 * originally. Note that you cannot change the parameters or modify the state
 * of the query once it is made. To sort and filter based on different critera,
 * you'll need to make a new query from the Persistence.service.
 *
